# Scratch Ideas

## Travel Page - Countries Visited
Create a page that shows countries I've been to, with a format like Instagram posts (grid/card layout with photos).

## Hiking View - Condense Scroll Length
Find a way to condense the hiking view so the scroll view isn't too long. Consider:
- Pagination
- Collapsed/expandable sections
- Filtering or grouping options
- Lazy loading with "Load more" button
