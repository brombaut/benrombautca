## First - a note on Big O

Big O notation is special notation that tells you how fast an algorithm is. For example, suppose you have a list of size _n_. Simple search needs to check each element, so it will take n operations. The run time in Big O notation is O(_n_). It's important to note that Big O doesn't tell you the speed in seconds, but rather lets you compare the number of operations. It tells you have fast the algorithm grows.

### Big O establishes a worst-case run time.

Suppose you're using simple search to look for a person in the phone book. You know that simple search takes O(_n_) time to run, which means in the worst case, you'll have to look through every single entry in your phone book. In this case, you're looking for Adit. This guy is the first entry in your phone book. So you didn't have to look at every entry - you found it on the first try. Did this algorithm take O(_n_) time? Or did it take O(1) (i.e., constant) time because you found the person on the first try?

Simple search still takes O(_n_) time. In this case, you found what you were looking for instantly. That's the best-case scenario. But Big O notation is about the _worst-case_ scenario. So you can say that, in the _worst case_, you'll have to look at every entry in the phone book once. That's O(_n_) time. It's a reassurance - you know that the simple search will never be slower than O(_n_) time.

> Note: Along with worst-case run time, it's also important to look at the average-case run time. More on that later...

### Some common Big O run times:

- O(log _n_), also known as _log time_. Example: Binary search.
- O(_n_), also known as _linear time_. Example: Simple search.
- O(_n_ \* log _n_). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
- O(_n<sup>2</sup>_). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
- O(_n!_). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesman.

## Searching Algorithms

### Simple Search

Just start at the beginning of the list and loop over all elements until either the item is found, or the end of the list is reached (in which case, the item is not in the list).

Time complexity: O(_n_)

```python
def simple_search(my_list, item):
  i = 0  # Start searching from the start of the list
  while i < len(my_list):  # While there are still elements to check in the list...
    guess = my_list[i]
      if guess == item:  # Found the item
        return i
  return None
```

### Binary Seach

The idea of binary search is that, with a sorted list and an item to find, you guess the middle item and eliminate half of all possibilities with each guess.

> Note: Binary search only works when your list is in sorted order.

Time complexity: O(log _n_)

```python
def binary_search(my_list, item):
  # low and high keep track of which
  # part of the list you'll search in.
  low = 0
  high = len(my_list) - 1

  while low <= high:  # While you haven't narrows it down to one element...
    mid = (low + high) / 2  # ...check the middle element
    guess = my_list[mid]
    if guess == item:  # Found the item
      return mid
    if guess > item:  # The guess was too high
      high = mid - 1
    else:  # The guess was too low
      low = mid + 1
  return None  # The item doesn't exist

my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

print(binary_search(my_list, 3))  # => 1
print(binary_search(my_list, -1)) # => None

```

### Breadth-First Search

> #### First: A note on _Graphs_
> A graph models a set of connections. Graphs are made up of nodes and edges. A node can be directly connected to many other nodes. Those nodes are called its neighbors. Graphs are a way to model how different things are connected to one another.

Breadth-first search is a search algorithm that runs on graphs. It can help to answer two types of questions:
- 1: Is there a path from node A to node B?
- 2: What is the shortest path from node A to node B?

The idea behind breadth-first search is that you maintain a queue of nodes you need to check (note that a `queue` follows the first in, first out rule (FIFO), as opposed to a `stack`, which follows a first in, last out rule (FILO)). You first visit all of your immediate neighbours (i.e., all the nodes you are directly connected with get added to the queue) and check to see if they are the node you are looking for. 

As you visit a node, you add all of its direct neighbours to your search queue (i.e., enqueue), taking care not to add any nodes to the queue that you have already visited. You then keep dequeueing nodes from your search queue until you either find the node you are looking for, or your queue becomes empty, in which case the node you are looking for is not present in the graph.

In summary, you search the nodes that are closest to you first, and keep expanding your search away from you until you find the node you want or you have searched the whole graph. Bread-first search guarentees that you will find the node in the graph if it is present, as well as that you will find the shortest path to that node.


**Time complexity**: If you search your entire graph, that means you'll follow each edge. So the running time is at least O(number of edges). You also keep a queue of every node to search. Adding a node to the queue takes constant time: O(1). Doing this for every node will take O(number of people) total. Therefore, breadth-first search takes O(number of people + number of edges), and is more commonly written as O(V+E) (V for vertices, E for edges)

```python
from collections import deque

graph = {}
graph["you"] = ["alice", "bob", "claire"]
graph["bob"] = ["arthur", "peggy"]
graph["alice"] = ["peggy"]
graph["claire"] = ["tom", "jonny"]
graph["arthur"] = []
graph["peggy"] = []
graph["tom"] = []
graph["jonny"] = []

def search(name):
  search_queue = deque()
  search_queue += graph[name]
  searched = []  # Who you've already searched
  while search_queue:
    person = search_queue.popleft()
    if not person in searched: # Only search this person if you haven't already searched them
      if person_is_who_we_are_looking_for(person):
        return True
      else:
        search_queue += graph[person]
        searched.append(person)  # Mark this person as searched
  return False

search("you")  # Will starting search from the "you" node and return true if we find the person we are looking for (implemented in person_is_who_we_are_looking_for, not included)
```


### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Lets you answer "What is the shortest path to X?" for weighted graphs (i.e., graphs with edges that have a weight or value assigned to them).

There are four steps to Dijkstra's algorith:
- 1: Find the "cheapest" node. That is the node you can get to in the least amount of time.
- 2: Check whether there's a cheaper path to the neighbors of this node. If so, opdate the costs of these neighbors.
- 3: Repeat until you've done this for every node in the graph.
- 4: Calculate the final path.

A full explanation on each of these steps will be a bit long-winded, so follow the code implementation below, and use Google is things aren't clear. Still, there are a couple points to note:
- You can't use Dijkstra's algorithm if you have negative weight edges (see [this explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-does-dijkstras-algorithm-fail-on-negative-weights/)). If you have negative weights, use the [Bellman–Ford Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/).
- Dijkstra's algorithm only works on graphs with no cycles, or on graphs with a positive weight cycle.

```python

'''
First describe the graph
'''
graph = {}
graph["start"] = {} # Start node
graph["start"]["a"] = 6 # Start node is connected to A node, with edge weight of 6
graph["start"]["b"] = 2 # Start node is connected to B node, with edge weight of 2

graph["a"] = {} # A node 
graph["a"]["fin"] = 1 # A node is connected to Finish node, with edge weight of 1

graph["b"] = {} # B node
graph["b"]["a"] = 3 # B node is connected to A node, with edge weight of 3
graph["b"]["fin"] = 5 # B node is connected to Finish node, with edge weight of 5

graph["fin"] = {}  # Finish node, doesn't have any neightbors


'''
Then you need a has table to store the costs for each node.

The cost of a node is how long it takes to get to that node from the start.
You know it takes 2 minutes from Start to node B. 
You know it takes 6 minutes to get to node A (although you may find a path that takes less time).
You don't know how long it takes to get to the finish.
If you don't know the cost yet, you put down infinity.
'''
infinity = float("inf")
costs = {}
costs["a"] = 6
costs["b"] = 2
costs["fin"] = infinity

'''
You also need another has table for the parents
'''
parents = {}
parents["a"] = "start"
parents["b"] = "start"
parents["fin"] = None

'''
Finally, you need an array to keep track of all nodes you've already processed, because you don't need to process a node more than once.
'''
processed = []

'''
Dijkstra's Algorithm
'''
node = find_lowest_cost_node(costs) # Find the lowest-cost node that you haven't processed yet.
while node is not None: # If you've processed all the nodes, this while loop is done.
  cost = costs[node]
  neighbors = graph[node]
  for n in neighbors.keys(): # Go through all the neighbors of this node.
    new_cost = cost + neighbors[n]
    if costs[n] > new_cost: # If it's cheaper to get to this neighbor by going through this node...
      costs[n] = new_cost # ...update the cost for this node.
      parents[n] = node # This node becomes the new parent for this neighbor.
  processed.append(node) # Mark this node as processed.
  node = find_lowest_cost_node(costs) # Find the next node to process, and loop.

def find_lowest_cost_node(costs):
  lowest_cost = float("inf")
  lowest_cost_node = None
  for node in costs: # Go through each node
    cost = costs[node]
    if cost < lowest_cost and node not in processed: # If it's the lowest cost so far and hasn't been processed yet...
      lowest_cost = cost # ...set it as the new lowest-cost node
      lowest_cost_node = node
  return lowest_cost_node

```

## Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort

The idea of binary search is that you loop over the list, find the smallest element (assuming you are sorting in ascending order), remove it from the list while adding it to the end of a new (initially empty) list, and then loop back over the original list, again finding the smallest element (remember that the first smallest element has been removed), and repeat this process until you have a sorted list.

Time complexity: O(_n<sup>2</sup>_)

```python
def find_smallest(arr):
  smallest_index = 0  # Stores the index of the smallest value
  smallest = arr[smallest_index]  # Stores the smallest value
  for i in range (1, len(arr)):
    if arr[i] < smallest:
      smallest = arr[i]
      smallest_index = i
  return smallest_index


def selection_sort(arr):  # Sorts an array
  new_arr = list()
  for i in range(0, len(arr)):
    smallest = find_smallest(arr)  # Finds the smallest element in the array...
    new_arr.append(arr.pop(smallest))  # ...and adds it to the new array
  return new_arr
```

### Quick Sort

What's the simplest array that a sorting algorithm can handle? Well, some arrays don't need to be sorted at all. Empty arrays and arrays with only 1 element are already sorted, so if we encounter these, we don't have to do anything because there's nothing to sort (base case).

An array with two elements is pretty easy to sort too. If the first element is larger than the second, just swap them.

If there are 3 elements, we can take a "divide and conquer" approach. First, pick an element from the array. This element is called the <i>pivot</i>. Now find the elements smaller than the pivot and the elements larger than the pivot. This is called <i>partitioning</i>. Now you have:

- A sub-array of all the numbers less than the pivot
- The pivot
- A sub-array of all the numbers greater than the pivot.
  The two sub-arrays aren't sorted. They're just partitioned. But if they were sorted, then you can just combine the whole thing like this - `left array + pivot + right array` - and you get a sorted array.

How do you sort the sub-arrays? Well, the quicksort base case already knows how to sort arrays of 0, 1 (base cases) and 2 (base case + 1 pivot) elements. So if you call quicksort on the two sub-arrays and then combine the results, you get a sorted array!

> No matter what pivot you pick, you can call quicksort recursively on the two sub-arrays.

Time complexity: Average: O(_n_ \* log _n_), Worst Case: O(_n<sup>2</sup>_)

```python
def quicksort(arr):
  if len(arr) < 2:  # Base case: arrays with 0 or 1 elements are already "sorted"
    return arr
  pivot = arr[0]  # Recursive case
  less = [i for i in arr[1:] if i <= pivot]  # Sub-array of all the elements less than the pivot
  greater = [i for i in arr[1:] if i > pivot]  # Sub-array of all the elements greater than the pivot

  return quicksort(less) + pivot + quicksort(greater)

```

## Greedy Algorithms
A greedy algorithm is simple: at each step, pick the optimal move. In technical terms _at each step you pick the locally optimal solution, and in the end you're left with the globally optimal solution_. It is important to note that greedy algorithms don't always work. However, sometimes, perfect is the enemy of good. Sometimes all you need is an algorithm that solves the problem pretty well. And that's where greedy algorithms shine, because ther're siple to write and usually get pretty close.

### E.g., The set-covering problem
Suppose you're starting a radio show. You want to reach listeners in all 50 states. You have to decide what stations to play on to each all those listeners. It costs money to be on each station, so you're trying to minimize the number of stations you plat on.

You have a list of stations. Each station covers a region, and there's overlap.

How do you figure out the smallest set of stations you can play on to cover all 50 states? Sounds easy? Turns out it's extremely hard. Here's how to do it:

1. List every possible subset of stations. This is called the _power set_. There are 2<sup>n</sup> possible subsets.
2. From these, pick the set with the smallest number of stations that covers all 50 states. 

The problem is, it takes a long time to calculate every possible subset of stations. It takes O(2<sup>n</sup>) time, because there are 2<sup>n</sup> subsets. It's possible to do if you have a small set of 5 to 10 stations, but let's say you are able to calculate 10 subsets per second, then for 100 stations, it will take 4x10<sup>21</sup> years. There's no algorithm that solves it fast enough. What can you do?

#### Approximation algorithms
You can use a greedy algorithm. Here's one that comes pretty close:

1. Pick the station that covers the most states that haven't been covered yet. It's ok if the station covers some states that have been covered already.
2. Repeat until all states are covered.

This is called an approximation algorithm. When calculating the exact solution will take too much time, an approximation algorithm will work. Approximation algorithms are judged by

- How fast they are
- How close they are to the optimal solution

Greedy algorithms are a good choice because not only are they simple to come up with, but that simplicity means they usually run fast too. In this case, the greedy algorithm runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time, where n is the number of radio stations.

Here us a code example

```python
states_needed = set(["mt", "wa", "or", "id", "nv", "ut", "ca", "az"])

stations = dict()
stations["kone"] = set(["id", "nv", "ut"])
stations["ktwo"] = set(["wa", "id", "mt"])
stations["kthree"] = set(["or", "nv", "ca"])
stations["kfour"] = set(["nv", "ut"])
stations["kfive"] = set(["ca", "az"])

final_stations = set()

best_station = None
states_covered = set()

while states_needed:
  best_station = None
  states_covered = set()
  for station, states_for_station in stations.items():
    covered = states_needed & states_for_station  # intersection
    if len(covered) > len(states_covered):
      best_station = station
      states_covered = covered
    states_needed -= states_covered
    final_stations.add(best_station)

print(final_stations)
```

## A quick note on NP-completeness
Some problems are famously hard to solve. The traveling salesperson and the set-covering problem are two examples. A lot of smart people think that it's not possible to write an algorithm that will solve these problems quickly.
### How do you tell if a problem is NP-complete?

Jonah is picking players for his fantasy football team. He has a list of abilities he wants: good quarterback, good running back, good in rain, good under pressure, and so on. He has a list of players, where each player fulfills some abilities. Jonah needs a team that fulfills all his abilities, and the team size is limited.

This is actually a set-covering problem. Jonah can use the same approximation algorithm we just did to create his team:

1. Find the player who fulfills the most abilities that haven't been fulfilled yet.
2. Repeat until the team fulfills all abilities (or you run out of space on the team).

NP-complete problems show up everywhere. It's nice to know if the problem you're trying to solve is NP-complete. At that point, you can stop trying to stop trying to solve it perfectly, and solve it using an approximation algorithm instead. But it's hard to tell if a problem you're working on is NP-complete. Usually there's a very small difference between a problem that's easy to solve and an NP-complete problem. For example, in the previous examples, we looked at shortest paths. You know how to calculate the shortest way to get from point A to point B. But if you want to fin the shortest path that connects several points, that's the traveling-salesman problem, which is NP-complete. The short answer: there's no easy way to tell if the problem you're working on is NP-complete. Here are some giveaways:

- Your algorithm runs quickly with a handful of items but really slows down with more items
- "All combinations of X" usually points to an NP-complete problem.
- Do you have to calculate "every possible version" of X because you can't break it down into smaller sub-problems? Might be NP-complete.
- If your problem involves a sequence (such as a sequence of cities, like traveling salesman), and it's hard to solve, it might be NP-complete.
- If your problem involves a set (like a set of radio stations) and it's hard to solve, it might be NP-complete.
- Can you restate your problem as the set-covering problem or the traveling salesman problem? Then your problem is definitly NP-complete.

NP-complete problems show up everywhere.

## Dynamic Programming - Briefly
Dynamic programming is useful _when you're trying to optimize something given a constraint_. For example, in the knapsack problem, you had to maximize the value of the goods you stole, constrained by the size of the knapsack.

You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems, and they don't depend on each other.

It can be hard to come up with a dynamic programming solution. Some general tips are:

- Every dynamic programming solution involves a grid.
- The values in the cells are usually what you're trying to optimize. For the knapsack problem, the values were the value of the goods.
- Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems. That will help you figure out what the axes are.

### Example - Longest common substring
Suppose you run dictionary.com. Someone types in a word, and you give them the definition.

But if someone misspells a word, you want to be able to guess what word they meant. Alex is searching for _fish_, but he accidentally put in _hish_. That's not a word in your dictionary, but you have a list of words that are similar

Similar to "HISH"
- "FISH"
- "VISTA"

Alex typed _hish_. Which word did Alex mean to type: _fish_ or _vista_?

#### Making the grid
What does the grid for this problem look like? You need to answer these question:

- What are the values of the cells?
- How do you divide this problem into sub-problems?
- What are the axes of the grid?

In dynamic programming, you're trying to _maximize_ something. In this case, you're trying to find the longest substring that two words have in common. What substring do _hish_ and _fish_ have in common? How about _fish_ and _vista_? That's what you want to calculate.

Remember, the values for the cells are usually what youre trying to optimize. In this case, the values will probably be a number: the length of the longest substring that the two string have in common.

How do you divide this problem into subproblems? You could compare substrings. Instead of comparing _hish_ and _fish_, you could compare _his_ and _fis_ first. Each cell will contain the length of the longest substring that two substring have in common. This also gives a clue that the axes will probably be the two words (i.e., with the rows being ["F", "I", "S", "H"'] and columns being ["H", "I", "S", "H"]).

#### Filling in the grid
Here's the formula for filling in each cell:

1. If the letters in the row/column pair don't match, the value is zero.
2. If they do match, this value is value of the top-left neighbor + 1

Here's how the formula looks in pseudocode:

```python
if word_a[i] == word_b[j]:
  cell[i][j] = cell[i-1][j-1] + 1
else:
  cell[i][j] = 0
```

One thing to note: for this problem, the final solution may not be in the last cell. For the knapsack problem, this last cell always had the final solution. But for the longest common substring, the solution is the largest number in the grid - and it may not be the last cell.


### Uses of dynamic programming

- Biologists use the longest common subsequence to find similarities in DNA strands.
- Git diff tells you the differences between two file, and it uses dynamic programming to do so.
- Levenshtein distance measures how similar two string are, and it uses dynamic programming. Levenshtein distance is used for everything from spell-check to figuring out whether a user is uploading copyrighted data.
