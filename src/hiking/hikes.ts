It's a massive stratovolcano, visible from miles around, and is known for its year-round glaciers and unpredictable weather. The mountain is surrounded by rugged terrain, alpine meadows, and dense forests.</p><p>We hiked up to Camp Muir, which is the highest you can go on the mountain without needing professional mountaineering gear like ropes or crampons. On the way up, we were stuck in a cloud and couldn't even see the direction we were heading—just following the route on AllTrails. We were walking on ice and snow most of the way, but when we got to the camp, we broke above the clouds and the view was incredible. This was my favourite hike on our roadtrip.</p>`,
