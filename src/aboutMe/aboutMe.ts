  <p>
  I'm a Software Engineering Researcher with the Centre for Software Excellence at Huawei Canada, where I work with a team researching bleeding edge topics and tools related to software engineering for high-performance computing and heterogeneous computing systems. I earned my M.Sc. from the School of Computing at Queen's University in 2022, and my B.Sc. in Software Engineering from the University of New Brunswick in 2019.

  I enjoy learning about a broad range of topics related to computer science and software engineering. Aside from my work, I am primarily interested in software supply chain management, software bots, data analytics & machine learning, and software reliability & security. I also have budding interests in software engineering in healthcare and medical informatics.
