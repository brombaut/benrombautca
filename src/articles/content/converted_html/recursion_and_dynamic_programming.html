<h1 id="recursion-and-dynamic-programming-briefly">Recursion and Dynamic
Programming (Briefly)</h1>
<h2 id="how-to-approach">How to Approach</h2>
<p>Recursive solutions, by definition, are built off of solutions to
subproblems. Many times, this will mean simply to compute
<code>f(n)</code> by adding something, removing something, or otherwise
changing the solution for <code>f(n-1)</code>. In other cases, you might
solve the problem for the first half of the data set, then the second
half, then merge those results.</p>
<p>There are many ways you might divide a problem into subproblems.
Three of the most common approaches to develop an algorithm are
bottom-up, top-down, and half-and-half.</p>
<h4 id="bottom-up-approach">Bottom-Up Approach</h4>
<p>The bottom-up approach is often the most intuitive. We start with
knowing how to solve the problem for a simple case, like a list with
only one element. Then we figure out how to solve the problem for two
elements, then for three elements, and so on. The key here is to think
about how you can <em>build</em> the solution for one case off of the
previous case (or multiple previous cases).</p>
<h4 id="top-down-approach">Top-Down Approach</h4>
<p>The top-down approach can be more complex since it’s less concrete.
But soetimes, it’s the best way to think about the problem.</p>
<p>In these problems, we think about how we can divide the problem for
case <code>N</code> into subproblems.</p>
<p>Be careful of overlap between the cases.</p>
<h4 id="half-and-half-approach">Half-and-Half Approach</h4>
<p>In addition to top-down and bottom-up approaches, it’s often
effective to divide the data set in half.</p>
<p>For example, binary search works with a “half-and-half” approach.
When we look for an element in a sorted array, we first figure out which
half of the array contains the value. Then we recurse and search for it
in that half.</p>
<p>Merge sort is also a “half-and-half” approach. We sort each half of
the array and then merge together the sorted halves.</p>
<h3 id="recursive-vs.-iterative-solutions">Recursive vs. Iterative
Solutions</h3>
<p>Recursive algorithms can be very space inefficient. Each recursive
call adds a new layer to the stack, which means that if your algorithm
recurses to a depth of <code>n</code>, it uses at least
<code>O(n)</code> memory.</p>
<p>For this reason, it’s often better to implement a recursive algorithm
iteratively. <em>All</em> recursive algorithms can be implemented
iteratively, although sometimes the code to do so is much more complex.
Before diving into recursive code, ask yourself how hard it would be to
implement it iteratively, and consider the tradeoffs of each
approach.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-programming-memoization">Dynamic Programming &amp;
Memoization</h2>
<p>Although people make a big deal about how scary dynamic programming
problems are, there’s really no need to be afraid of them. In fact, once
you get the hang of them, these can actually be very easy problems.</p>
<p>Dynamic programming is mostly just a matter of taking a recursive
algorithm and finding the overlapping subproblems (that is, the repeated
calls). You then cache those results for future recursive calls.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can study the pattern of the recursive calls and
implement something iterative. You still “cache” previous work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note on terminology: Some people call top-down dynamic programming
“memoization” and only use “dynamic programming” to refer to bottom-up
work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the simplest examples of dynamic programming is computing the
nth Fibonacci number. A good way to approach such a problem is often to
implement it as a normal recursive solution, and then add the caching
part.</p>
<h2 id="fibonacci-numbers">Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
<p>We’ll walk through a couple approaches to compute the nth Fibonacci
number.</p>

<p>What is the runtime of this function? If you said <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>)</span> (as many
people do), these are not correct. Study the code path that the code
takes. Drawing the code paths as a tree (that is, the recursion tree) is
useful on this and many recusrive problems.</p>
<p><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brombaut/articles-authored/main/assets/images/recursion_and_dynamic_programming/00_tree_fib_recursive.png" /></p>
<p>Observe that the leaves on the tree are all <code>fib(1)</code> and
<code>fib(0)</code>. Those signify the base cases.</p>
<p>The total number of nodes in the tree will represent the runtime,
since each call only does <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1)</span>
work outside of its recursive calls. Therefore, the number of calls is
the runtime.</p>
<p>How many nodes are in the tree? Until we get down to the base cases
(leaves), each node has two children. Each node branches out twice.</p>
<p>The root node has two children. Each of those children has two
children (so four children total in the “grand-children” level). Each of
those grand-children has two children, and so on. If we do this <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> times, we’ll have roughly <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>)</span> nodes.
This gives us a runtime of roughly <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, it’s slightly better than <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>)</span>. If you
look at the subtree, you might notice that (excluding the leaf nodes and
those immediately above it) the right subtree of any node is always
smaller than the left subtree. If they were the same size, we’d have an
<span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>)</span>
runtime. But since the right and left subtrees are not the same size,
the true runtime is closer to <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1.6<sup><em>n</em></sup>)</span>. Saying
<span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>)</span> is
still technically correct though as it describes an upper bound on the
runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, if we were to implement this on a computer and time it, we
would see the number of seconds to run the function to completion
increases exponentially.</p>
<p>We should look for a way to optimize this.</p>
<h4 id="top-down-dynamic-porgramming-or-memoization">Top-Down Dynamic
Porgramming (or Memoization)</h4>
<p>Have a look at the recursion tree above. Where do you see identical
nodes?</p>
<p>There are lots of identical nodes. For example, <code>fib(3)</code>
appears twice and <code>fib(2)</code> appears three times. Why should we
recompute these from scratch each time?</p>
<p>In fact, when we call <code>fib(n)</code>, we shouldn’t have to do
much more than <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span>
calls, since there’s only <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span> possible values we can
throw at <code>fib</code>. Each time we compute <code>fib(1)</code>, we
should just cache this result and use it later.</p>
<p>This is exactly what memoization is.</p>
<p>With just a small modification, we can tweak this function to run in
<span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span> time. We simply
cache the results of <code>fib(i)</code> between calls.</p>

<p>While the first recursive function may take over a minute to generate
the 50th Fibonacci number on a typical computer, the dynamic programming
method can generate the 10,000th Fibonacci number in just fractions of a
millisecond. (Of course, with this exact code, the <code>int</code>
would have overflowed very early on.)</p>
<p>Now if we draw the recursion tree, it looks something like this (the
black boxes represent cached calls that returned immediately):</p>
<p><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brombaut/articles-authored/main/assets/images/recursion_and_dynamic_programming/01_tree_fib_top_down_imbalanced.png" /></p>
<p>How many nodes are in this tree now? We might notice that the tree
now just shoots straight down, to a depth of roughly <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>. Each node of those nodes has one
other child, resulting in roughly <span
class="math inline">2<em>n</em></span> children in the tree. This gives
us a runtime of <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span>.</p>
<p>Often it can be useful to picture the recursion tree as something
like this:</p>
<p><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brombaut/articles-authored/main/assets/images/recursion_and_dynamic_programming/02_tree_fib_top_down_balanced.png" /></p>
<p>This is not actually how the recusrion occurred. However, by
expanding the further up nodes rather than the lower nodes, you have a
tree that grows wide before it grows deep. (It’s like doing this
breadth-first rather than depth-first.) Sometimes this makes it easier
to compute the number of nodes in the tree. All you’re really doing is
changing which nodes you expand and which ones return cached values. Try
this if you’re stuck on computing the runtime of a dynamic programming
problem.</p>
<h4 id="bottom-up-dynamic-programming">Bottom-Up Dynamic
Programming</h4>
<p>We can also take this approach and implement it with bottom-up
dynamic programming. Think about doing the same things as the recursive
memoized approach, but in reverse.</p>
<p>First, we compute <code>fib(1)</code> and <code>fib(0)</code>, which
are already known from the base cases. Then we use those to compute
<code>fib(2)</code>. Then we use the prior answers to compute
<code>fib(3)</code>, then <code>fib(4)</code>, and so on.</p>
