<p>The details of the Linux directory structure are outlines in the
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, or FHS (<a
href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml">https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml</a>).
Below are the most important subdirectories in root:</p>
<h3 id="bin"><strong><em>/bin</em></strong></h3>
<p>Contains ready-to-run programs (also known as <em>executables</em>),
including most of the basic Unix commands such as <code>ls</code> and
<code>cp</code>. Most of the programs in <em>/bin</em> are in binary
format, having been created by a C compiler, but some are shell scripts
in modern systems.</p>
<h3 id="dev"><strong><em>/dev</em></strong></h3>
<p>Contains device files.</p>
<h3 id="etc"><strong><em>/etc</em></strong></h3>
<p>This core system configuration directory contains the user password,
boot, device, networking, and other setup files.</p>
<h3 id="home"><strong><em>/home</em></strong></h3>
<p>Holds home (personal) directories for regular users.</p>
<h3 id="lib"><strong><em>/lib</em></strong></h3>
<p>An abbreviation for <em>library</em>, this directory holds library
files containing code that executables can use. There are two types of
libraries: static and shared. The <em>lib</em> directory should contain
only shared libraries, but other lib directories, such as
<em>/usr/lib</em>, contain both varieties as well as other auxiliary
files.</p>
<h3 id="proc"><strong><em>/proc</em></strong></h3>
<p>Provides system statistics through a browsable directory-and-file
interface. Much of the <em>/proc</em> subdirectory structure on Linux is
unique, but many other Unix variants have similar features. The
<em>/proc</em> directory contains information about currently running
processes as well as some kernel parameters.</p>
<h3 id="run"><strong><em>/run</em></strong></h3>
<p>Contains runtime data specific to the system, including certain
process IDs, socket files, status records, and, in many cases, system
logging. This is a relatively recent addition to the root directory; in
older systems, you can find it in <em>/var/run</em>. On newer systems,
<em>/var/run</em> is a symbolic link to <em>/run</em>.</p>
<h3 id="sys"><strong><em>/sys</em></strong></h3>
<p>This directory is similar to <em>/proc</em> in that is provides a
device and system interface.</p>
<h3 id="sbin"><strong><em>/sbin</em></strong></h3>
<p>The place for system executables. Programs in <em>/sbin</em>
directories relate to system management, so regular users usually do not
have <em>/sbin</em> components in their command paths. Many of the
utilities found here don’t work if not run as root.</p>
<h3 id="tmp"><strong><em>/tmp</em></strong></h3>
<p>A storage area for smaller, temporary files that you don’t care much
about. Any user may read to and write from <em>/tmp</em>, but many users
may not have permission to access another user’s files there. Many
programs use this directory as a workspace. If something is extremely
important, don’t put it in <em>/tmp</em> because most distributions
clear <em>/tmp</em> when the machine boots and some even remove its old
files periodically. Also, don’t let <em>/tmp</em> fill up with garbage
because its space is usually shared with something critical (the rest of
<em>/</em>, for example).</p>
<h3 id="usr"><strong><em>/usr</em></strong></h3>
<p>Although pronounced “user”, this subdirectory has no user files.
Instead, it contains a large directory hierarchy, including the bulk of
the Linux system. Many of the directory names in <em>/usr</em> are the
same as those in the root directory (like <em>/usr/bin</em> and
<em>/usr/lib</em>), and they hold the same type of files. (The reason
that the root directory does not contain the complete system is
primarily historic - in the past, it was to keep space requirements low
for the root.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>/usr</em> directory may look relatively clean at first
glance, but a quick look at <em>/usr/bin</em> and <em>/usr/lib</em>
reveals that there’s a lot here; <em>/usr</em> is where most of the
user-space programs and date reside. In addition to <em>/usr/bin</em>,
<em>/usr/sbin</em> and <em>/usr/lib</em>, <em>/usr</em> contains the
following:</p>
<h4 id="usrinclude"><strong><em>/usr/include</em></strong></h4>
<p>Holds header files used by the C compiler.</p>
<h4 id="usrlocal"><strong><em>/usr/local</em></strong></h4>
<p>Is where admins can install their own software. Its structure should
like like that of <em>/</em> and <em>/usr</em>.</p>
<h4 id="usrman"><strong><em>/usr/man</em></strong></h4>
<p>Contains manual pages.</p>
<h4 id="usrshare"><strong><em>/usr/share</em></strong></h4>
<p>Contains files that should work on other kinds of Unix machines with
no loss of functionality. These are usually auxiliary data files that
programs and libraries read as necessary. In the past, networks of
machines would share this directory from a file server, but today a
<em>share</em> directory used in this manner is rare because there are
no realistic space restraints for these kinds of files on contemporary
systems. Instead, on Linux distributions, you’ll find <em>/man</em>,
<em>/info</em>, and many other subdirectories here because it is an
easily understood convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="var"><strong><em>/var</em></strong></h3>
<p>The variable subdirectory, where programs record information that can
change over the course of time. System logging, user tracking, caches,
and other files that system programs create and manage are here. (You’ll
notice a <em>/var/tmp</em> directory here, but the system doesn’t wipe
it on boot.)</p>
<h3 id="boot"><strong><em>/boot</em></strong></h3>
<p>Contains kernel boot loader files. These files pertain only to the
very first stage of the Linux startup procedure, so you won’t find
information about how Linux starts up its services in this
directory.</p>
<h3 id="media"><strong><em>/media</em></strong></h3>
<p>A base attachment point for removable media such as flash drives that
is found in many distributions.</p>
<h3 id="opt"><strong><em>/opt</em></strong></h3>
<p>This may contain additional third-party software. Many systems don’t
use <em>/opt</em>.</p>
