<ul>
<li><h3 id="encapsulate-what-varies">Encapsulate What Varies</h3>
<p>Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them
from what stays the same. Take what varies and “encapsulate” it so it
won’t affect the rest of your code. This results in fewer unintended
consequences from code changes and more flexibility in the
system.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="program-to-an-interface-not-an-implementation">Program to an
Interface, NOT an Implementation</h3></li>
<li><h3 id="favor-composition-over-inheritance">Favor Composition over
Inheritance</h3></li>
<li><h3 id="loose-coupling">Loose Coupling</h3>
<p>Strive for loosely coupled designes between objects that interact.
Loosely coupled designes allow us to build flexible systems that can
handle change because they minimize the interdependency between
objects.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="open-closed-principle">Open-Closed Principle</h3>
<p>Class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. The
goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new
behavior without modifying existing code. What do we get if we
accomplish this? Designes that are resilient to change and flexible
enough to take on new functionality to meet changing requirements. Be
careful when choosing the areas of code that need to be extended:
applying the Open-Closed Principle everywhere is wasteful and
unnecessary, and can lead to complex, hard-to-understand code.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="dependency-inversion-principle">Dependency Inversion
Principle</h3>
<p>Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
High-level components should not depend on low-level components; rather,
they should both depend on abstractions.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="principle-of-least-knowledge">Principle of Least
Knowledge</h3>
<p>Talk only to your immediate friends. When you are designing a system,
be careful of the number of classes it interacts with and also how it
comes to interact with those classes. This prevents us from creating
designs that have a large number of classes coupled together so that
changes in one part of the system cascade to other parts, When you build
a lot of dependencoes between many classes, you are building a fragile
system that will be costly to maintain and complicated for others to
understand. The principle provides some guidelines (Law of Demeter):
take any object; now from any method in that object, the principle tells
us that we should only invoke methods that belong to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The object itself</li>
<li>Objects passed in as a parameter to the method</li>
<li>Any object the method creates or instantiates</li>
<li>Any components of the object</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h3 id="the-hollywood-principle">The Hollywood Principle</h3>
<p>“Don’t call us, we’ll call you” The Hollywood Principle gives us a
way to prevent “dependency rot.” Dependency rot happens when you have
high-level components depending on low-level components depending on
high-level components depending on side-ways components depending on
low-level components, and so on. When rot sets in, no one can easily
understand the way a system is designed. With the Hollywood principle,
we allow low-level components to hook themselves into a system, but the
high-level components determine when they are needed, and how. In other
words, the high-level components give the low-level components a “don’t
call us, we’ll call you” treatment.</p></li>
<li><h3 id="single-responsibility-principle">Single Responsibility
Principle</h3>
<p>A class should have only one reason to change. Every responsibility
of a class is an area of potential change, More than one responsibility
means more than one area of change. This principle guides us to keep
each class to a single responsibility.</p></li>

<h2 id="creational-patterns">Creational Patterns</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="simple-factory"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/simplefactory">Simple
Factory</a></strong></h3>
<p>Simple Factory isn’t an actual design pattern, more of a programming
idiom that is commonly used.</p>
<h3 id="abstract-factory"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/abstractfactory">Abstract
Factory</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating
families of related or dependent objects without specifying their
concrete classes.</p>
<h3 id="factory-method"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/factorymethod">Factory
Method</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an
object, but lets subclasses decide which clas to instantiate. Factory
method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">abstract</span> Product <span class="fu">factoryMethod</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="bu">String</span> type<span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="singleton"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/singleton">Singleton</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instannce, and
provides a global point of access to it.</p>
<p>The <code>getInstance()</code> method is static, which means it’s a
class method, so you can conveniently access this method from anywhere
in your code using <code>Singleton.getInstance()</code>. That’s just as
easy as accessing a global variable, but we get benefits like lazy
initialization from the Singleton. The <code>uniqueInstance</code> class
variable holds our one and only instance of Singleton. A class
implementing the Singleton pattern is more than a Singleton; it is a
general purpose class with its own set of data and methods.</p>
<h4 id="handling-multithreading-issues">Handling Multithreading
Issues</h4>
<p><em>SynchronizedSingleton</em> - By adding the synchronized keyword
to <code>getInstance()</code>, we force every thread to wait its turn
before it can enter the method. That is, notwo threads may enter the
method at the same time. Keep in mind that synchronizing a method can
decrease performance by a factor of 100, so if a high-traffic part of
your code begins using <code>getInstance()</code>, another option might
have to be considered.</p>
<p><em>EagerSingleton</em> - If your application always creates and uses
an instance of the Singleton or the overhead of creation and runtime
aspects of the Singleton are not onerous, you may want to create your
Singleton eagerly.</p>
<p><em>DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton</em> - With double-checked locking,
we first check to see if an instance is created, and if not, THEN we
synchronize. This way, we only synchronize the first time through. The
<code>volatile</code> keyword ensure that multiple threads handle the
<code>uniqueInstance</code> variable correctly when it is being
initialized to the Singleton instance</p>
<h2 id="structural-patterns">Structural Patterns</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="adapter"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/adapter">Adapter</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another
interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that
couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="composite"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/composite">Composite</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree
structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients
treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Using a
composite structures, we can apply the same operations over both
composites and individual objects. In other words, in most cases, we can
ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual
objects.</p>
<h3 id="decorator"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/decorator">Decorator</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an
object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.</p>
<p>The java.io package heavily uses the decorator design pattern.</p>
<p>Each decorator HAS-A (wraps) a components, which means the decorator
has an instance variable that holds a reference to a components.
Decorators implement the same interface or abstract class as the
component they are going to decorate.</p>
<h3 id="facade"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/facade">Facade</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of
interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that
makes the subsystem easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-patterns">Behavioral Patterns</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="command"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/command">Command</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby
letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or
log requests, and support undoable operations.</p>
<p>Command declares an interface for all commands. A command is invoked
through its <code>execute()</code> method, which asks a receiver to
perform an action. It can also perform <code>undo()</code> actions.</p>
<h3 id="iterator"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/iterator">Iterator</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an
aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying
representation. It also places the task of traversal on the iterator
object, not on the aggregate, which simplifies the aggregate interface
and implementation, and places the responsibility where it should
be.</p>
<p>The Iterator interface provides the interface that all iterators must
implement, and a set of methods for traversing over elements of a
collection. Here we’re using the java.util.Iterator. If you don’t want
to use Java’s Iterator interface, you can always create your own.</p>
<h3 id="observer"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/observer">Observer</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Oberver Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
so that when one object changes state, all of its dependets are notified
and updated automatically.</p>
<p>Objects use the Subject interface to register as observers and also
to remove themselves from being observers. Each Subject can have many
observers.</p>
<p>A concrete subject always implements the Subject interface. In
addition to the register and remove methods, the concrete subject
implements a notifyObservers() method that is used to updateall the
current observers whenever state changes. The concrete subject may also
have mthods for setting and getting its state.</p>
<p>All potential observers need to implement the Observer interface.
This interface just has one method, update(), that gets called when the
Subject’s state changes.</p>
<p>Concrete observers can be any class that implements the Observer
interface. Each observer registers with a concrete subject to recieve
updates.</p>
<h3 id="state"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/state">State</a></strong></h3>
<p>The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its
internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.</p>
<p>The Context is the class that cna have a number of internal states.
In our example, the GumballMachine is the Context. Whenever the
request() is made on the Context it is delegated to the state to
hande.</p>
<p>The State interface defines a common interface for all concrete
states; the states all implement the same interface so they are
interchangeable. State</p>
<p>ConcreteStates handle requests from the Context. Each ConcreteState
provides its own implementation for a request. In this way, when the
Context changes state, its behavior will change as well</p>
<p>Many concrete states are possible</p>
<h3 id="strategy"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/strategy">Strategy</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates
each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
vary indepentently from clients that use it.</p>
<h3 id="template-method"><strong><a
href="https://github.com/brombaut/BEC/tree/master/design-patterns/templatemethod">Template
Method</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Template Method Pattern defines the skelwton of an algorithm in a
method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets
subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
algorithm’s structure</p>
<p>The AbstractClass contains the template method and abstract versions
of the operations used in the template method. The template method makes
use of the primitiveOperations to implement an algorithm. It is
decoupled from the actual implementation of these operations.</p>
<p>There may be many ConcreteClasses, each implementing the full set of
operations required by the template method. The ConcreteClass implements
the abstract operations, which are called when the templateMethod()
needs them.</p>
<p>A hook is a method that is declared in the abstract class, but only
given an empty or default implementation. This gives subclasses the
ability to “hook into” the algorithm at various points, if they wish; a
subclass is also free to ignore the hook.</p>

- A collection of design patterns used together</h2>
<hr />
<p><em>What did we do?</em></p>
<p><strong>We started with a bunch of Quackables…</strong></p>
<p><strong>A goose came along and wanted to act like a Quackable
too.</strong> So we used the <em>Adapter Pattern</em> to adapt the goose
to a Quackable. Now, you can call quack() on a goose wrapped in the
adapter and it will honk!</p>
<p><strong>Then, the Quackologists decided they wanred to count
quacks.</strong> So we used the <em>Decorator Pattern</em> to add a
QuackCounter decorator that keeps track of the number of times quack()
is called, and then delegates the quack to the Quackable it’s
wrapping.</p>
<p><strong>But the Quackologists were worried they’d forget to add the
QuackCounter decorator.</strong> So we used the <em>Abstract Factory
Pattern</em> to create ducks for them. Now, whenever they want a duck,
they ask the factory for one, and it hands back a decorated duck. (And
don’t forget, they can also use another duck factory if they want an
undecorated duck.)</p>
<p><strong>We had management problems keeping track of all those ducks
and geese and quackables.</strong> So we used the <em>Composite
Pattern</em> to group Quackables into Flocks. The pattern also allows
the Quackologist to create sub-flocks to manage duck families. We used
the <em>Iterator Pattern</em> in our implementation by using java.util’s
iterator in ArrayList.</p>
<p><strong>The Quackologists also wanted to be notified when any
Quackable quacked.</strong> So we used the <em>Observer Pattern</em> to
let the Quackologists register as Quackable Observers. Now they’re
notified every time any Quackable quacks. We used iterator again in this
implementation. The Quackologists can even use the Observer Pattern with
their composites.</p>
